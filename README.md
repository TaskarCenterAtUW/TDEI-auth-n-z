## Building the project

### IDE

Import the project in your preferred IDE by selecting POM.xml.

### Cli

*Note: Navigate to the cloned repository directory before proceeding for below steps

### 1. Building the server

Use Maven command to build the server. Below mvn command will

1. Cleans the project and removes all files generated by the previous build
2. Builds the maven project and generates the jar package to target directory

```
$ mvn clean install
```

### 2. Running the server

```
$ cd target
$ java -jar -Dspring.profiles.active=dev gateway-0.0.1.jar
```

### 3. Browse API documentation

Navigate to the below link for API documentation and API playground

## CI/CD [Azure Pipeline]

### Continuous Integration (CI)

Currently CI is not implemented as part of Azure pipeline. Test automated integration will be taken up in next
development cycle.

### Continuous Deployment (CD)

Check-in to the master branch triggers the Azure pipeline [auth-n-z] CI/CD process which will build the source code,
generate the package and create the docker image. Docker image will then be deployed to Azure app services.
